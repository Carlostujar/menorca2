               <h1>Ferreries, a town with essence</h1>
              
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/16.jpg">There are places that have something special and one doesn’t know exactly why. Streets in which to lose oneself for no particular reason. An atmosphere that attracts for reasons that one is unaware of. Ferreries fits this description. This central town with just over 4.500 inhabitants is offered to the visitor as a white carpet with red touches, crowned by the bell tower of the Sant Bartomeu (Bartholomew) the parish gave the municipality its origin.</p>
               <p>This temple is found in the centre of the old part of town which has a coquette nucleus, with no grand pretensions that forms a very agreeable area. The most historic streets in Ferreries offer great harmony and this is where you will find the town hall, the old wells that used to supply the town, the old fish market and the traditional architecture. You also breathe tranquillity and calm in these streets, as if stress was unable to penetrate this town tinted with white. </p>
               <p>In this town the inhabitants still have the custom in the summer months to take their Menorcan chairs (like cinema directors chairs) out in the streets to spend a while chatting. This is known as sitting in the fresh air, it is a sign of the authenticity of the people who are sincere and generous. Ferreries combines the tradition, the essence of the town, with the modernity of present times. </p>
               <p>This town has always been a place for entrepreneurs. The “ferreriencs” have unfailingly known how to open doors and move forward. It isn’t in vain that this small town makes shoes that are sold worldwide and have trodden the most important cat-walks in the world on the feet of renowned models. Ferreries also produces authentic avarques from the traditional to the most innovative. Add to this important furniture businesses plus costume jewellery, farmhouse cheeses and artisan products.  </p>
               <p>Any visitor to Ferreries must take the opportunity to try the bread. The bakers in the town are famous for their mouth watering delicious bread. On Saturday mornings there is a farmers market. Smell, observe and savour the true fruits of Menorca. Flavoursome and natural.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/16bis.jpg">Ferreries was born at the end of the XIII century, and although it may seem surprising it is the highest municipality on the island, 141 metres above sea level; and its territory contains some of the highest points on the island. S´Enclusa, site of the old American base, Santa Agueda (Agatha) that contains the ruins of the Arab castle of Sant Agayz, bestows a special personality on the municipality. Apart from this on the road to the summit of Santa Agueda there is a stretch of an old mediaeval road. Imagine treading the path where generations of Menorcans have trodden! This is an emblematic place, where the Arabs took their last refuge on the island and has given rise to numerous legends including one about a golden calf. Myths and stories apart it is worth the climb, (it takes about 45 minutes) to enjoy the views that the second highest point on the island offers.</p>
               <p>Further out from the town, the municipality offers a multitude of places to visit, very different depending if one opts for the north or south. In the north the unspoilt wild countryside, carved by the tramontana wind has left scenery such as Ets Alocs, a stony cove surrounded by a sea of crystal clear water, ideal for those who love untamed beaches. On the way spend a moment visiting the Menorcan Natural Science Museum in the Binissuès farm. It will surprise you.</p>
               <p>If you prefer the south there are three outstanding locations. One is the Cala Galdana beach, a spectacular urban beach ideal for family tourism or anyone in search of all the commodities. A perfect combination of complete tourist services with scenery surrounded by cliffs.</p>
               <p>The second enticing spot is Cala Mitjana a totally unspoilt beach whose turquoise waters and fine white sand are a delight for people who want untouched natural areas. Let the sun caress you, feel the sea breeze and take in your surroundings and discover the small Cala Mitjaneta. The image of this beach has been chosen for many postcards that are sent from the island. There must be a reason why so many choose it.</p>
               <p>The third “must see” is the Barranc d´Algendar. This is one of the most spectacular valleys in Menorca. It ends in a little creek that flows by Cala Galdana, another place that is a cradle of legends and myths. Ask about them while you meander in the beautiful scenery. Take care of the surroundings of such a privileged area that shows all its natural splendour.</p>
               <p>If you like country walks, don’t miss the chance to visit the Cami Reial, (Royal Road). This centuries old way crossed the island from Ciutadella to Mahón, but time and the opening of other routes has left it in disrepair. However the efforts of the citizens of Ferreries have managed to recoup a stretch of the lane which is open once more. In fact it is an excellent way to join the path of the Barranc D´Algendar. </p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/16bis1.jpg">Let us return to the town. If you have walked round the old part, we recommend that you sit for a few minutes on the benches in the Plaza España. Reformed a few years ago it is the neurological centre of town; where the markets and fairs take place and where children play whilst their parents have coffee. Sit down and absorb the essence of the island, don’t be in a hurry, just live the moment. It is what here they call “no passis pena”, an expression that could be translated as “calm down, everything will be alright”. Carpe diem (Seize the day). </p>
               <p>Ferreries celebrates its fiestas or festivities in august. On the 23, 24 and 25 they pay homage to their patron San Bartomeu and they do it with horses in the starring roles. Following the ritual of the rest of the municipalities on the island the celebration has as the high point, the jaleo which is on the afternoon of the 23rd and midday on the 24th in a sloping square, which makes the actuation of the “caixers” even more spectacular if that is possible. On the 25th the town lets its hair down with a peculiar jaleo where the horses are substituted for donkeys. This is a different uncomplicated event where the main idea is to have a good time.</p>
               <p>If you drive along the main road you will catch a glimpse of Ferreries and a poster a few metres from the road. It is well worth driving into the town of white walls and red roofs. Even after seven centuries of history the origin of the name of the town is still not clear. Some say it comes from “Ferrers” (blacksmiths or farriers), suggesting the possibility that there was one established there to attend to the horses that passed through the town. Others believe that it originates from “Fraria”, because the San Bartomeu church was built on land that belonged to a guild of a religious and military order.</p>
               <p>Whatever the reason, independently of the origin of the name of the town, Ferreries has a lot to offer. A town that invites a peaceful stroll, that contains beaches apt for all tastes, those who love virgin territory and for those who want something more than a mantle of fine white sand. It has the most important ravines on the island, and it still has something, indefinable that attracts and draws you in. Stop in Ferreries.</p>
