               <h1>Sant Climent, so much in so little space</h1>
              
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/22.jpg">The village of San Climent (St. Clement) is barely four kilometres from Mahón. With fewer than 1000 inhabitants and over 200 years of history it is well worth a visit during your time in Menorca.  San Climent has the feeling it has always had, of a village that is not in a hurry and with an emphasis on family life. Here the expression The Island of calm is a reality.</p>
               <p>The yellow and white church is the most outstanding feature; located in the main square, the centre of life in the village. Sit there, look around and feel that life can be lived at another pace.</p>
               <p>If you are a lover of good music don´t miss the jazz nights that are organised in the Sant Climent Casino, a typical local bar that looks after your musical preferences and takes care of your taste buds. Their tapas are splendid.</p>
               <p>San Climent makes beer that is 100% Menorcan, made on the island with the most up to date machinery. Imagine combining a chilled beer, with the Menorcan sun, and the pure Mediterranean air. Can you think of anything better? Well yes, because San Climent has Es Molí des Foc, one of the best rated restaurants in Menorca. Don’t miss it. </p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/22bis.jpg">Hidden nearby is one of the pearls of Menorca’s Roman past. The Paleochristian Basilica at Fornàs de Torelló. There is almost nothing left of the VI century structure, but the mosaic floor is still there. This is formed of lions and palm trees which represent death and the tree of life. Observe it well and think that Menorcans trod here 1.500 years ago. Impressive isn’t it?</p>
               <p>Near the basilica you can contemplate a talaiot, and even a circular prehistoric home. Draw close and see what the Menorcan stones hide. Truly the archaeological heritage of the island is spectacular. </p>
               <p>Let us go back to Sant Climent, like every town in Menorca it has its local fiestas. These are celebrated on the third weekend in August and once again horses take the leading role. However Sant Climent has something different. The first Monday after the fiestas the santclimenters take part in a water battle with gusto, with one purpose in mind, enjoyment. If you are thinking of going it is advisable to wear adequate clothes. The artificial downpour is normally torrential.</p>
               <p>As you can see Sant Climent has a great deal to offer. Do take the opportunity to stop a while in this enclave, situated very near to the Airport.</p>
