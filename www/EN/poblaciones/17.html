               <h1>Es Mercadal, right in the centre of Menorca</h1>
              
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/17.jpg">The neurological centre of the municipality of Es Mercadal is the town of the same name; the municipality has an extension of 234 square kilometres with boundaries to the east with Alaior, the south with Es Migjorn Gran and the east with Ferreries. Most of its residents are concentrated in Es Mercadal and Fornells, on the north coast. There are also various residential centres, where the tourist activity lies.</p>
               <p>The actual municipality is part of the ancient Mercadal village and Santa Agueda Castle that once comprised of Ferreries and Es Migjorn Gran who are now independent.</p>
               <p>Es Mercadal is one of the most ancient towns in Menorca. In 1301, the King Jaume (James) II of Mallorca authorised the celebration of a market on Thursday, in a place called the Pobla de Mercadal. This is surely the origin of the name of the village as Mercatallus in Latin means market place.</p>
               <p>Es Mercadal has a charming area surrounding the historic centre, that has grown around the stream by the Pla de ses eres. The highest part is the Sant Martí (Martin) church, situated amongst the streets with the white houses and red roofs. </p>
               <p>The Sant Martí church crowns the urban geography of the town. It is a temple dating from the mid XVIII century built on an older sanctuary (XV - XVI centuries) that was completed by the early XIX century. It has a solid aspect topped with a square bell tower.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/17bis.jpg">A few metres away is the town hall popularly known as “La Sala” (The room), its large entrance the main feature, also the balcony on the upper floor and the old bell tower.</p>
               <p>Of the architectural heritage it is worth mentioning the Aljub (Water Cistern) a building from the British Dominations. The huge deposit was built in 1735 when Richard Kane was governor, and has a capacity of 300 tons.</p>
               <p>Other elements of great ethnological value include Pepe Carreteros humble blacksmiths, now a small museum or the small flour mill d´en Biel, more modest than the imposing s´Aranji, a group of buildings and installations that formed the infrastructure of the old flour factory considered to be one of the few examples of industrial archaeology on the island. </p>
               <p>In the surroundings of the town three windmills are dotted on the rural landscape, the Tramuntana, des Racó, and d´enfora, on the Cami den Kane going towards Ferreries.</p>
               <p>On the outskirts of the town we find the access road to Monte Toro, the most important mountain on the island. It is 357 metres (1171.26 feet) above sea level and offers spectacular views over the island. It is also the spiritual centre of the Menorcans. This is where the sanctuary of the Mare de déu del Toro, (Mother of God of the bull), has been established. The statue is not exempt from legends that date from the XIII century.</p>
               <p>There is a great variety of natural scenery near to Es Mercadal. Outstanding are the Basses de Lluriac  an area of natural treasures because of its biodiversity this is in a marshy coastal zone formed of various temporary wetlands and the end of the stream.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/17bis1.jpg">One of the most beautiful areas in Menorca is the shoreline in the municipality; the longest extension of unspoilt coastline in Menorca, it is amply protected. The northerly most point of Menorca is cape Cavalleria which is topped by the oldest lighthouse on the island, built in the middle of XIX century. Nearby is Sa Nitja a Roman name, from the early settlement situated there and valued for its human and atmospheric level. This zone is a synthesis of the ecological richness of the Menorcan coast, in exceptional surroundings. </p>
               <p>The unspoilt beaches with turquoise waters on this coast line are also idyllic, Cavalleria, Binimel-à or Pregonda. Other beaches are in tourist areas, Tirant, Son Saura or Arenal den Castell all with easy access and facilities.</p>
               <p>The Cami de Cavalls borders the Mercadal coastline and gives spectacular and unrepeatable views. Together with the Cami den Kane (first road that crossed the island dating from the XVIII century) it is one of the historically important roads in the municipality.</p>
               <p>The notable fiestas in Es Mercadal are those of Sant Martí, with a civic religious aspect: celebrated in the third weekend in July with horses as the main protagonists. </p>
               <p>Es Mercadal is known for its great gastronomic offer. Added to the popular macaroons and carquinyols (small almond biscuits) there is an extensive culinary tradition, plus interesting samples of local dishes.</p>
               <p>Es Mercadal has specialised in the service sector, with commercial activities centred next to the Artisan Centre in Menorca or the radio museum, and they also celebrate important shows, typical ones are for the Menorcan purebred horses or partridges.</p>
               <p>In recent years seasonal handicraft and agricultural markets have become popular especially the Thursday afternoon ones from June to September where large numbers of people congregate in the streets.</p>
               <p>Because of its extension and diversity it is possible to practice infinity of sports from Golf in Son Parc, horse riding or sailing in Fornells.</p>
