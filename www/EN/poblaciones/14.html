               <h1>Ciutadella. One of our own</h1>
              
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/14.jpg">Once again I lose myself in the old streets of Ciutadella, full of light, under an intense blue sky and so close to a sea that is everywhere, that whitens the trees with salt on the days when the tramontana wind blows, and the old ghosts return with transparency to my mind. Memories come back of years gone by when resounding footsteps in the streets hardly disturbed the sound of a cats meow or the anguished barking of a homeless dog. I touch again the walls swollen by layers of whitewash, the bare stones of the palaces, the cracked paint on the old windows; I think again about this small world, where everything fits, inclined to fantasy, to loneliness, to abandonment, and perhaps even love.  At times I believed that time stood still in this small half enchanted city of my birth, that crossing the streets one passed through an invisible lamina to eternity, always the same appealing labyrinth of alleys, the insistent ringing of the bells, the black cassocks worn by the priests, the head scarves of women in mourning, aged in the flower of youth, the  clip-clop of the horses, the neighbours who accompanied the dead filing past…. Now I don’t believe that. I have seen many familiar faces disappear some known some not, close and distant relatives, popular and picturesque people characters that no longer liven up these walks, that maybe smile from the rough stones on the buildings, converted in shadows, or maybe in the lights in this Ciutadella of light and dark, cock-and-bull stories, changes, traditions and unmovable truths that have long ceased to exist. I open my eyes, lift my head and look: time passes by, never stands still, it only stopped in my imagination.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/14bis.jpg">Silent streets, deserted years ago, when so proverbial stories have it the city slept on the laurels of the lineage of the Catalan conquerors who grabbed farmhouses and private houses from the hands of the arab settlers. Streets where the sounds of hammers of the workers in family businesses, an eternal rhythmical tapping sound on the marble they had to glue. The shouts of the mothers calling their children who played in the winding streets where no cars ever passed. Maybe the clattering sound of sewing machines, where workers stitched together pieces of leather for future pairs of shoes. Maybe a bouncing ball that disturbed the peace of the old people who walked with bent backs wearing their black berets, supported by walking sticks, clenching a  stub of caliqueño (a type of cigar)  between their teeth. Boys playing football in the middle of the street; a girl making exaggerated movements with her arms and assuring everyone that she is swimming in an imaginary sea, other lads playing marbles using English words for all the movements, dating from the occupations in the eighteenth century; the girls jumping with the skipping rope, or over a line, hide and seek, and a deceptive game where they shouted •Give it back, give it back its not ours”.</p>
               <p>Every morning the children came home for breakfast after the tedious daily mass, the mothers prepared rolls with tomato, or bread with oil and salt or sugar for them, who then ate them in the streets causing envy amongst the starving dogs. Some of the lucky ones saw how their parents toasted sobrasada on a fork over the charcoal fire, the orange sausage with the white bread. These were possibly the children of established costume jewellers  who made necklaces and earrings with crystal beads like the ones used to dupe the American Indians or African tribes, these necklaces and brooches constituted an industry that delayed the arrival of tourism on the island for many years, these and leather goods, together with the farmers who reared cattle and shaped the cheeses, which age with a robust flavour, full of contrasts like the countryside of this windy island eroded by inclement weather, sacked by various civilizations that have passed through.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/14bis1.jpg">The farmers went to their dwellings every Sunday, and put on their smart suits over their tanned skins, their hair suspiciously blond, their eyes strangely blue, their tall bodies, their measured way of speaking, and with something of an actor about them as they walked around their homes; the aspect of a romantic late night, the faith of the charcoal maker, the profound respect for the landowner, their eyes set on one girl who would accompany them until death did them part. The landowners or “Señores” whose possessions were received after the island was conquered by King Alfonso III of Aragon, barely had a black carriage, which moved as slowly as the country people, with a small oval window in the back of the soft roof, like a circus big top. They received their tenant farmers with a paternal air, they blessed their marriages, joined in with their boleros and strumming on the guitar - let the moon fall in the middle of the square, and you are one of the four pieces-, came to the baptisms of their offspring, ate biscuits filled with jam and drank glasses of sweet wine negating the progress that was being boasted about in Mallorca, the first tourist businesses. </p>
               <p>I remember the first time I heard German in Santandria I thought it was being invented it sounded so strange to me. The first tourists wore tea shirts with flower patterns and shorts that were so wide that as my father said, four people would fit in and he would have hung his head in shame if he had had to wear them at home. When Barceló the policeman told a foreign girl that she couldn´t wear a bikini on the beach, that it had to be a one piece swimsuit, she happily asked him which bit should she remove. A friend of mine commented that in Cala Morell three Swedish girls were knitting while topless, and told the crowd that had gathered that it was quite normal there, ha, ha... Suddenly everything seemed normal even Adolfo Suarez said “something can be considered as normal if it is normal in the street”. We were half a century behind and we solved this by two years of nudity. Quickly the same streets and terraces in the port filled with multicoloured clothes, market stalls  for the visitors, the hangers on who spoke Italian with the Italian girls, those who seemed to teach the British English, -this is the table; yes, yes...- and the latin lovers... I don´t know if we ever digested it but tourism is here, reachable every season, uncared for like the hen with eggs of lead, pillager and pillaged, converted in the only industry that we have left, or almost the only one.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/14bis2.jpg">Let us sit in the port of Ciudadela one night in August. We listen to the sound of mixed conversations, from languages badly learned including from native inhabitants, different rhythmic music coming from each bar and restaurant, all fighting for their space, the sound of the boats creaking in the water, swells our muscles and alcohol clouds our brain and we can stroll again through the dark streets, still forgotten by God as in the times of Barbarossa, nowadays converted in thwarted markets. We forget about the past and walk towards a future that is uncertain with each new dawn, romances that last one day, fandango dances learnt in a dancing school, sounds of the guitar and castanets, typical of artisans and supermarkets and books like this for tourists who maybe never learnt the language spoken between these four old walls where Ciutadella still rises.</p>
