               <h1>Sant Lluís, French roots</h1>
              
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/19.jpg">Menorca has always been an appetizing territory for many cultures and civilizations, and all have left an imprint on the island. For seven years between1756 and 1763 Menorca was French, and the most evident legacy of this stage is the town of Sant Lluis.</p>
               <p>It was founded in honour of the king Louis (XV) of France and as was customary at the time the town was designed with straight, simple roads that nowadays still form the central nucleus of town; the main and most important street, el Cós has an ample selection of shops and businesses.</p>
               <p>Sant Lluis with just over 7.500 inhabitants is situated in the east of the island. The main landmark is the Moli de dalt, one of the three windmills that two centuries ago were part of town life. De Dalt is certainly the best preserved and the most emblematic. Its blue and white dome gives a personal stamp to the area. The sails with over 200 years of history stand out on the skyline. If you arrive from Mahón the mill will give you a friendly welcome, its imposing figure framed against a blue sky. Don’t forget to visit the ethnological museum on the ground floor. </p>
               <p>Another recommended visit is to the church. The neoclassical building, also born during the French period is another symbol of a municipality which lays claim to its Gallic roots and also keeps up with the times, showing its best face to the visitor.</p>
               <p>Sant Lluis is undoubtedly one of the municipalities in Menorca most geared to tourism. Its privileged situation encourages this. Washed by the Mediterranean in the south and east, the land is generous with coves and beaches, corners that have served for the start of small urbanizations that are comfortable and agreeable for visitors. The area is so attractive that many summer visitors have ended up living in this area - with scattered corners of white sand and crystal waters.  </p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/19bis.jpg">Binibeca is one of the motives that explain the attraction of Sant Lluis. Its fishing village transformed into a tourist centre breathes magic from all its corners. Its little streets that open the way as best they can between the pristine white houses has been immortalised in thousands of photographs. I am sure you will also succumb to its charm; it’s logical. The pure Mediterranean scenery and the murmur of the waves that can be heard in the houses, there is no doubt that Binibeca is very special.</p>
               <p>Sant Lluis offers more coves and nooks and crannies to visit. These nucleuses have great personalities, enclaves that combine a tourist vocation with a Menorcan essence. Cala Alcaufar for example is really authentic, it started as a spot for fishing and a place for Menorcans to spend the summer.  Biniancolla is another of these niches, 100% Menorcan with a maritime tradition it is ideal for snorkelling and exploring the sea bed. Binissafúller, Cap den Font, Son Ganxo….. The format is practically the same, although each place has its own identity. Discover them, we recommend them.</p>
               <p>Punta Prima is a more comfortable beach for families. A generous amount of sand combines with shallow seas perfect for children. If you lie on the beach and look at the horizon you will see the the silhouette of an island. This is the Illa de l´Aire, which serves as a habitat for the Balearic lizard, unique in the world, friendly and completely black, its isolation has made it adapt to the minute 30 hectare isle, crowned with a lighthouse.  </p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/poblaciones/19bis1.jpg">If you want unique scenery that will take your breath away, go to Cala Rafalet. This little cove opens between two cliffs and shows the visitor waters so crystal clear that it is almost impossible not to submerge in them. If you do decide to visit here, take your time, take in the scenery, become one with nature and breathe, simply breathe.</p>
               <p>Sant Lluis can and should be discovered on foot. From the urban centre you can take routes that will show you typical buildings, those that were dotted around before the French decided to include them in the municipality. It is also possible to visit examples of the ethnic heritage, like the Es Pujol talaiot or the coastal defence tower Talaia de Torret. Find out about these walks and the multiple paths that pass through the municipality. Sant Lluis has more to offer than you imagine.</p>
               <p>This town opens its arms to the tourist, its main economy is tourism; and it looks after visitors with the maximum amiability, and offers a variety of services so that it can be enjoyed to the maximum. </p>
               <p>If you happen to stay at the end of August don’t miss the fiestas in honour of the patron saint. On August 25th or on the weekend after if the 25th is a working day; the town gives itself over to the horses, tradition and fun. The typical Menorcan style of fiestas, Sant Lluis immerses itself in the magic of the “Caixers” and their horses, the “bots” (traditional jump using the hind legs of the horses) and the music. In this municipality there is also a parade of floats which is extremely popular and hundreds of people go to see it. If you have a chance to see them don’t lose it.</p>
               <p>In fact don’t miss Sant Lluis and its surroundings, visit the coves, the town centre and its varied ethnic heritage. Sant Lluis is an obligatory stop during your stay in Menorca.</p>
