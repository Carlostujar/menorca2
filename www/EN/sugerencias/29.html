               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/sugerencias/29.jpg">If you are a lover of excursions, you have chosen well in coming to Menorca. It is ideal for cyclists. If your passion is horses and you want to discover hidden corners on horseback the island is the perfect place. Menorca has all that is necessary to practice sports peacefully. To walk, cycle, ride, play golf, tennis, cricket….All is possible on the island.</p>
               <p>Menorca has an ample selection for hikers. Put on some good walking shoes and take one of the routes here. Starting with the <em>Camí de Cavalls</em> (bridle path) and its twenty tracts, and also going on routes with specialised companies. Both coastal and country paths have beautiful views that make any exertions so worth while. Doesn´t the sound of the sea on the coast, or the birds singing in the woods and fields make the effort seem easier?  </p>
               <p>While going on foot or pedalling round the island are interesting pastimes, riding round is an almost unbeatable experience. Just imagine riding on unspoilt beaches sitting on top of the most venerated animal on the island. If the Menorcans have a bridle path, there must be a good reason. The people here care intensely for their horses. Let yourself be guided by experts and discover the island without your feet touching the ground. Doesn’t it sound exciting? </p>
               <p>All the above choices are very attractive for those who want active tourism. The island offers a varied selection of sporting activities. There are many installations often with monitors if needed. Cricket is played on the island in the Mediterranean climate, organised by the British here. A cocktail full of advantages, wouldn’t you agree? If golf is to your taste then Son Parc is your option, designed for beginners up to the most advanced, with an essence of the Mediterranean. </p>
               <p>As you can see in Menorca you can just rest, but you can also tone your self and keep fit in a relaxing way. You decide. The island will provide everything for you. Slow Menorca is here waiting for you. Shall we play? </p>
