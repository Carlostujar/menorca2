               <h1>Eat and live well</h1>
              
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/sugerencias/27.jpg">Eating well is one of the pleasures that you must satisfy when on holiday. The gastronomy says a lot about each town, and the islands cuisine is a prolongation of the island character: authentic, unassuming and with a myriad of facets. Isn’t Menorca like that?   A natural land, full of different hues and tremendously authentic?</p>
               <p>The Menorcans find lots of ways to satisfy their palates in restaurants. Don’t leave the island without tasting some of the most typical dishes. You will find options for all tastes and all pockets. The Menorcans are experts at cooking the fish that they catch daily. The restaurants will inform you about the fresh fish they have, and you can try them grilled, baked, and <em>a la espalda</em> (literally on its back, delicious!). Discover Cap-roig (Scorpion fish), or John Dory. Try the Menorcan version of stuffed squid, it will surprise you…</p>
               <p>Evidently when one talks about Menorcan cuisine, one must include the lobster caldereta (sliced lobster cooked in a sauce and served with thin slices of baked bread). A sublime unique dish, cooked with the Menorcan spiny lobster, a delight in any meal. Although it is not cheap, it is worth trying at least once, even better if it can be by the sea, accompanied by a Menorcan white wine.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/sugerencias/27bis.jpg">The Menorcans know how to make the most of locally grown produce. What were once basic dishes almost for survival show us gastronomy full of flavour. Try the local soup oliaigua accompanied by figs, surely one of the most Menorcan dishes that exist. Also much prized are stuffed aubergines or egg plants, a country dish that can please the most cosmopolitan tastes. </p>
               <p>And when it is time for the pudding, we must tell you that Menorcans have a very sweet tooth. Their confectionary includes a variety of sweet cakes and biscuits, like <em>pastissets</em>, <em>carquinyols</em>, <em>amargos</em> (macaroons), and <em>crespells</em>. These can also be eaten mid morning, or at tea time. You will find them in any of the confectioners or bakers where you will also find a lot of savoury pies and pasties including <em>formatjades</em>.</p>
               <p>If you want a substantial pudding, tasty and exquisite, try almond cake. If you add a scoop of ice-cream the combination deserves 10 points. Have it on a day of indulgence.</p>
               <p>To speak of Menorcan cuisine in such a short article signifies leaving out products that should not be forgotten. Such as Menorcan cheese, sausages, wine, honey, liqueurs... You can see that on this island you live well, and eat even better. </p>
