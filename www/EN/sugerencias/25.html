To go home with all that the island offers is impossible. However if you want to shop there are great opportunities. Although the island seems small, it offers a great variety of businesses and shops where you can find what you are looking for. </p>
               <p>In the town centres there are a multitude of shops in which to browse and find things you are looking for. Especially in Ciutadella and Mahón; because of their larger size they offer the visitor a place to buy while walking through privileged surroundings. </p>
               <p>You must not miss the leather products while you are here. Shoes made on the island are internationally famous. They are identified by quality and design and are easy to find. Don’t forget the avarques, the sandals that are the most Menorcan of all. You will be surprised at the great range of models available and their versatility. There are excellent clothes shops too; some 100% Menorcan, some high street chic; and some designer clothes - from basic to exquisite garments.</p>
               <p>And if you want artisan or agricultural products, Menorca is the ideal place. Don’t leave without a bottle of wine, a cheese, or a typical sausage from the island. You will easily find them and you can take home a piece of Menorca to tempt your palate and help you remember.</p>
               <p>Lose yourself in the local shops. You will find what you are looking for.
