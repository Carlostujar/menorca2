               <h1>Night time and glamour</h1>
              
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/sugerencias/26.jpg">The sun is tremendously generous with Menorca, but you can’t leave the island without knowing its moon and the bewitching night. When the sun goes to bed, this piece of land changes its aspect, but without losing its essence. Under a veil of stars, Menorca is another Menorca. Authentic as always, but different.</p>
               <p>The island offers two large areas with nightlife, the ports in Ciutadella and Mahón where the largest number of night spots are located, but you can also find some in the tourist resorts. Get some information before you plan your night out. You can dance, chat, have a drink or simply sit with friends while the sun takes a deserved rest in the Mediterranean waters. There are many different variations, you can dance to the latest hits, or try the more exclusive locations with chill-out and glamour. The terraces are also an excellent option on summer nights. Stroll, look and choose. You will find some way to pass the Menorcan night.</p>
               <p>Forget the big nightclubs, and places filled with hundreds of people with strident music blaring out. Menorca can be coquettish at night, look for the balance. </p>
               <p>And if you are coquettish, the island offers everything to give the night elegance and distinction. Take a trip round the jewellers and look for the hand made products crafted by the artisans. Remember that costume jewellery had its glory days on the island, and there are still local companies who stand out for originality and design.</p>
               <p>You can find unique pieces that can Menorcanise you, and you can take an inimitable souvenir from this little paradise in the Mediterranean. Have a look at our advertisers. They will not defraud you.</p>
