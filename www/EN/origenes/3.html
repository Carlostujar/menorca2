               <h1>History of Menorca</h1>
              
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/origenes/3.jpg">From 902 until 1287, Menorca was in the hands of the muslims. The new population originated from the barbary farmers. From them we have inherited the system of irrigation and toponymy (place names).</p>
               <p>The berbers lived in farmhouses and cottages scattered throughout the island; they worked the land, especially in the valleys, making excellent use of water. They built the Santa Agueda (St. Agatha) castle as a place of refuge in case of a Christian attack. The fort was walled, had two water cisterns and different buildings to resist the assault.</p>
               <p>Menorca changed hands in 1287 when Alfonso III the liberal expelled the berbers. The islands again became Christian.</p>
               <p>In 1295, under the Treaty of Anagni Menorca is returned to Jaime II, king of the kingdom of Mallorca and the uncle of Alfonso III. Jaime II organised the legislation of the new Menorcan settlers. </p>
               <p>On August 30th 1301 a proclamation, the letter of exemptions and privileges, regulated the social, political, economic and urban structure of the island. This document is considered an authentic constitution for the Menorcans. These and other privileges granted to Menorca were compiled in the Libre Vermell that can be found in Ciutadella.</p>
               <p>The second grand document dictated by Jaime 11 was the Pariatge, on March 19th 1301. This established the ecclesiastical divisions, 7 parishes were founded with the object of repopulating the island, the origins of some of the present towns and villages.</p>
               <p>Menorca, during centuries produced cereals and wool of high quality which they commercialised in Mallorca, Barcelona and Italy. They also produced ewe’s cheese.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/origenes/3bis.jpg">The institutions in Menorca begin to function. In the XIV century there was already a Universitat for Menorca situated in Ciutadella with similar duties to the actual Consell Insular (Island Council). In 1439 the Govenor Galcerán de Requesens implanted a system where lots were drawn publicly for municipal positions according to the social standing and estates the people possessed. These municipal regimes lasted until the XIX century, when the present system was introduced. Menorca had mainly a farming population with a few artisans, Ciutadella being the capital of the island. </p>
               <p>Between the XV and XVII centuries, Menorca suffered from pirate attacks. They are noted for their cruelty, the assault on Mahón by Barbarossa in 1535 and by Mustafá Pi Ali on Ciutadella in 1558 decimating the Menorcan population. The answer consisted in constructing defence towers, and fortifying Mahón and Ciutadella, building the castles of Sant Felip (Philip) and Sant Antoni (Antony) and mobilising companies of armed men to defend the island. </p>
               <p>The Menorcans live in a society with religious roots, marked by a calendar full of religious and traditional festivities, in which religious acts and jousting with horses are the main entertainment. Political decisions are taken at the heart of the General University of Menorca in Ciutadella. This situation changes when the universities in Mahón (1640) and those of Mercadal and Alayor (1651) achieve independent administrations. Since then each university (town hall) will collect and manage its own taxes. </p>
               <p>The landscape is the product of centuries of work by the Menorcans. Since 1287 the farmers have worked the land, which is ceded to them in exchange for an annual royal tithe, and they are known as gentleman farmers or lease holders. At the end of the XVII century, the landowners lose economic power and introduce a new system of partnership. The land produces cereals (corn, basically) and production is increased on vines, potatoes and vegetables.</p>
               <p>The XVIII century brings a changing epoch. The strategic importance of Menorca and the port of Mahón is of interest to European powers. As a consequence of the Spanish wars of Succession in 1713 Menorca passed into British hands. After this Menorca comes under the control of the British, Spanish and French as if it was a toy.</p>
               <p>The British dominations (1713-1756, 1763-1982 and 1798-1802) have left us a singular legacy: Defence towers, St. Philips Castle was fortified, Fort Marlborough, the hospital on the Isla del Rey, the water cistern in Mercadal, Kane’s Road, the founding of Es Castell (Georgetown) in 1771 and Governor Kane moved the capital to Mahón.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/origenes/3bis1.jpg">The French domination was brief (1756-1763) and they founded Sant Lluis. Economic activity increases thanks to commerce, ship building in the naval base in the port of Mahón and the presence of a large military contingent. In 1745 Es Migjorn Gran is founded and two decades later in 1768 the island loses 1.400 Menorcans who emigrate to Florida.</p>
               <p>The XIX century is an epoch of contrasts. At the beginning the dynamic economy of the previous century continues but a legislative change dictated by Madrid impedes the free commercialisation of cereals. The ship building in Mahón disappears in a few decades and wine production decreases.</p>
               <p>Between 1830 and 1835 many Menorcans emigrated to Algeria encouraged by France to consolidate their colony there. 10.000 Menorcans, a quarter of the population, installed themselves in the new Eldorado, Algeria converted into a small Menorca in the North of Africa.</p>
               <p>During the second half of the XIX century and the first third of the XX century Menorca’s economy improved. Mid XIX century more dairy cattle were introduced and more Mahón cheese produced, a delicacy that will be recognised internationally.</p>
               <p>Thanks to the interest of the Cuban ands Puerto Rican markets, the exports of high quality leather goods increased, the origin of the present day Menorcan shoe makers, known world wide for their quality and design.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of the XX century Menorca together with Mallorca, produce purses and chain mail evening bags made of gold and silver, the vanguard of the fashion in Europe. Thousands of women made them. When fashions changed the industry transformed into magnificent producers of costume jewellery and hinges, the only place in Spain that manufactured them.</p>
               <p>During the XX century the production of cheese, leather and costume jewellery consolidated. It wasn’t until the sixties that the tourist industry arrived, and tourist urbanizations and the first hotels were built.</p>
               <p>Menorca was declared a Biosphere Reserve in 1993 and in 2003 the Insular Territorial Plan (P.T.I.) was approved, these have helped to confirm Menorca’s identity as an island where the heritage and environment are cared for.</p>
               <p>Today they are working hard so that the talayotic culture in Menorca can be declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. There are over 1.400 archaeological sites from that period that the visitor can discover on an island no larger that 700 square metres.</p>
               <p>Menorca is the ideal island to enjoy, gastronomy, artisan work, and a cultural heritage with a difference. Its history and its people together with the land offer tranquillity that will allow the visitor to know us and enjoy their stay. Enjoy it.</p>
