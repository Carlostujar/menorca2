               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/origenes/1.jpg">Menorca cannot be imitated. Nestling in the north of the Balearic Islands it has kept its original enchantment. It is striking, yet understated and balanced. Its 702 square kilometres offer multiple choices to visitors. The sea, coves and beaches are like paradise. Daily life can be forgotten as one discovers hidden corners and views. Islanders have preserved the authenticity of the island which has adapted over time without losing its identity.</p>
               <p>The Menorcans care about the environment, and share the island with those who want to disconnect for a while and live experiences they will never forget.</p>
               <p>Conservation work over the years has not been in vain and Menorca enjoys the distinction of being a Biosphere Reserve awarded by UNESCO, something the Menorcans are very conscious of. They know the importance of their surroundings and landscape which they care for greatly.</p>
               <p>Menorca is green like its woods, white like its houses, turquoise like the sea which caresses the coasts, black like its horses, golden like its cheese, a rainbow of colours like the variety of its people. Menorca is authentic, impossible to define with words. You have to discover it and live it to understand what it feels like here.</p>
               <p>Menorca is, simply Menorca. </p>
