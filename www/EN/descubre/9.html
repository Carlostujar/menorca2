               <h1>Menorca, a rich culture</h1>
              
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/descubre/9.jpg">Menorca is much more that sun and beach. For centuries the island has been a melting pot of cultures and civilizations, shaping a mosaic which is the profile of Menorca today, an island with a cultural richness, far greater than it may appear. </p>
               <p>The first inhabitants left their mark. The archaeological heritage on the island is incredible. Navetas, talaiots, or taules occupy many corners of the island, and remind us of how it all began. Lose yourself in a site and imagine life centuries ago.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/descubre/9bis.jpg">Century after century, Menorca has grown culturally. The English, French, Spanish... Their presence on the island has caused the multicultural air that today is preserved and encouraged. Menorca is full of cultural attractions. On your agenda you must include a visit to the Museo de Menorca (museum in Mahón) or the Municipal museum in Ciutadella. There is also the Military museum in Es Castell, Fort Marlborough and the imposing fort La Mola at the mouth of the port of Mahón. The Diocese museum in Ciutadella has an impressive art collection in a charming building. The offer is even more extensive, it is worth investigating. </p>
               <p>And if Menorca has a jewel in the crown, it is without doubt the Teatro Principal (Opera House) in Mahón. The oldest opera house in Spain it was built in 1829 and after successive reforms and extensions it is a modern theatre that offers a great variety of shows. The original character of the building, organised by the operatic impresario Giovanni Palagi in the XIX century has been preserved. The capacity is for a thousand people in the horseshoe shaped auditorium which has three floors of balconies plus “the Gods”. Outside traditional Menorcan stone combines with the reforms undertaken by three Menorcan architects which are modern while respecting the traditional. In recent years it has consolidated as one of the principal cultural entities on the island. Periodically there are all types of theatre and opera. Consult the programme and you will be sure to find something to your liking.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/descubre/9bis1.jpg">The Island still offers more. It is surprising the great quantity of cultural entities that function on the island cultivating different modes and arts. Especially in the summer you will find a great many activities that will fascinate you. Don’t leave the island without seeing the traditional folk dancing or without enjoying any of the live music that is programmed throughout the summer months. </p>
               <p>As you can see Menorca is far more that sunshine and the beach. Here we live a good life and it is well known Mens sana in corpore sano (A sound mind in a healthy body).</p>
