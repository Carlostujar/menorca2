               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/descubre/11.jpg">The Menorcans know how to get the best from the fruits of the land and sea and transform them into delicious recipes. All the cultures that have passed through have left some influence and this mixture has shaped the gastronomy that we have nowadays, simple but excellent.</p>
               <p>As the sea is always so close Menorcan cooking has fish and shellfish as one of its star products. They must always be very fresh, and they form the base of an infinity of recipes, including stuffed squid or what has become the most famous dish on the island, the lobster “Caldereta”. Originally a meal for the fishermen it is now known throughout the world as an exquisite dish. </p>
               <p>As Mediterranean people the Menorcans attach a lot of importance to vegetables. What were originally menus of necessity are still being passed down through the generations and are culinary delights. Stuffed, roasted, baked, or cooked as part of a recipe, an ingredient as simple as a vegetable can be served in many different ways. If you can, try a plate of “oliaigu”, a humble soup, made from a base of fresh vegetables it is traditionally eaten with fresh figs. It is basic but full of flavour.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/descubre/11bis.jpg">The local lamb, reared with care is highly appreciated, also pork, beef and rabbit. The Menorcan farmers make sausages such as sobrassada, cuixot, carnixua and botifarró, excellent products to put on a slice of bread rubbed with tomato.</p>
               <p> And we mustn’t forget the cheese, with the denomination of origin Mahón-Menorca. Made with milk from cows that graze on pastures near the sea, it is well known outside the Mediterranean. </p>
               <p>To accompany the cheese try some of the local wines, the local viticulturists and enologists and have been recouping a tradition that was extensive centuries ago.</p>
               <p>Ah! Don’t forget that salsa Mahonesa (mayonnaise) one of the most utilised sauces on the planet was born here. Isn’t that a demonstration of the artists in the Menorcan kitchen?</p>
