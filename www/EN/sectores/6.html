               <p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="imagen" src="../../img/sugerencias/25.png">The Menorcans know the island offers raw materials that are carefully transformed to make products of value, using this benchmark local industries have exported practically world wide.</p>
               <p>Without doubt the leather industry is emblematic in Menorcan Industry. Quality and design are shown in the shoes. Menorca is the cradle of famous brands that are known all over the world. Shoes that are worn by Hollywood stars are created on a small Mediterranean Island. </p>
               <p>When we talk about leather goods in Menorca we must remember the avarques. A sandal that was born in the countryside is now widely known because of its comfort and simplicity. Nowadays you can find a huge selection, something appropriate for every occasion. Remember the authentic avarques are the ones made in Menorca.</p>
               <p>Also significant in Menorcan industry is costume jewellery. This was known throughout the world and the island lived periods of great splendour. The industry still survives. The Menorcans, always associated with the sea, make llauts, comfortable boats for people to cruise tranquilly round the coasts.</p>
               <p>The Menorcans have always known how to make the most of their land without using machinery. They did it centuries ago when they built kilometres of dry stone walls, without concrete, and without foundations, just the art of fitting the stones together, this technique has stood the test of time and the walls are still standing. Today there is a diverse offer of local handicrafts. Ceramics, agricultural products, wooden goods, jewellery, clothes... Do visit the local handicraft markets and see for yourself the handmade goods.</p>
